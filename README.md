## AINZOOAL FILMS
The project involves developing an interactive website where users can engage with each other by commenting on various content, such as anime, documentaries, and series. In addition to commenting, users can create specific sessions to discuss a particular topic in real-time. These sessions can be shared, allowing multiple people to join and have simultaneous conversations about the same subject.

Key features include:
- **Favorite Content**: Users can mark their favorite content for easy access later.
- **Session Creation**: Users can create interactive sessions to discuss content with others in real-time.
- **Comments**: Users can leave comments on each piece of content and reply to one another, fostering discussion.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Within sessions, users can exchange messages simultaneously, enabling dynamic, live interaction.

The website provides a social environment focused on sharing opinions and discussions on various types of media, offering an interactive and collaborative experience.

## Language and Framework
This project was developed using React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. React powers the dynamic user interface, while JavaScript handles the interactive functionality throughout the site. Tailwind CSS was used to style the components, providing a clean and responsive design.

## Methods
This project utilizes several methods to enhance functionality and user interaction. Key methods include:

- **useState**: Manages the state of components, keeping track of changes like session creation, comments, and favorites.
- **useEffect**: Handles side effects in the application, such as fetching data when a component mounts or updating when certain conditions change.
- **useContext**: Provides a global state to manage user data and session information across the application.
- **API Fetching**: Utilizes JavaScript's `fetch` method to communicate with backend services, retrieving and sending data like session details and user comments.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS classes are used to create a mobile-first design, ensuring the interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.

These methods combine to create a seamless, interactive experience for users, enabling real-time communication and dynamic content updates.
